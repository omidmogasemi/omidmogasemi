### Hi, I'm Omid 👋

### My Current Work 
- **Melty Labs**, working on [Conductor](https://conductor.build/), a Mac desktop application for orchestrating coding agents in parallel. Backed by YCombinator and Matrix Capital. 

### Previous Work 
- [**Netflix**](https://www.netflix.com/), where I worked on the Machine Learning Platform. I designed and built the interfaces and APIs for the platform's ML model training orchestration system. Used Figma, React + TypeScript, GraphQL, and Clojure. I had also worked on [Polynote](https://github.com/polynote/polynote), an OSS polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support. 
- [**Principal Financial Group**](https://www.principal.com/), where I interned on the PUPP Life Calc team, working on an error handling service in a Java Spring Boot microservice app as well as modernizing an older Java application to AWS using Lambdas, DynamoDB, and TypeScript. 
- [**Eduworks**](https://eduworks.com/), where I interned and was responsible for obtaining data used to train NLP models using webscraping and various job sourcing APIs in Python. 
- [**CodeLab**](https://www.codelabdavis.com/), a UC Davis club I was the VP of Technology and Co-Founder of where I mentored teams' quarterly projects for clients and created over twenty hours of educational material to teach students concepts such as React, Node.js, MongoDB. 
- [**Hands Together**](https://www.handstogether-sa.org/), a non-profit pre-school for at-risk children in Santa Ana. I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website. I have since upgraded it to Webflow due to a lack of time to maintain its original implementation in React and Node.js. 
- [**HackDavis**](https://hackdavis.io/), where I was Co-President and the Technical Lead responsible for making our websites (using React + Firebase). 
- **Komma**, a start-up simplifying the way people schedule meetings. Built using the MERN stack. Participated in the Spring 2021 UCD PLASMA accelerator cohort.
