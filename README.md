### Hi, I'm Omid ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 

I'm a SWE currently working at Netflix. I take passion in using my skills to enact social good and strive to make sure that I leave a lasting positive impact on the world in the code that I write. 

### My Current Work 
- **Netflix**, where I am a SWE for the Machine Learning Platform team working on [Polynote](https://github.com/polynote/polynote), an OSS polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support. 

### My Past Work 
- [**Principal Financial Group**](https://www.principal.com/), where I interned on the PUPP Life Calc team, working on an error handling service in a Java Spring Boot microservice framework as well as modernizing an older Java application to AWS using the CDK, Lambdas, DynamoDB, and TypeScript. 
- [**Eduworks**](https://eduworks.com/), where I interned and was responsible for obtaining data used to train NLP models for a job competency system with Python. The data was fetched via various job sourcing APIs as well as webscraping, and then programatically cleaned and tagged in preparation for model usage. 
- [**CodeLab**](https://www.codelabdavis.com/), a UC Davis club I was the VP of Technology and Co-Founder of where I mentored teams with implementing their quarterly projects for clients and created over twenty hours of educational material to teach students concepts such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc. 
- [**Hands Together**](https://www.handstogether-sa.org/), a non-profit pre-school for at-risk children in Santa Ana. I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website. I have since upgraded it to use Webflow due to a lack of time to maintain its original implementation in React and and Node.js. 
- [**HackDavis**](https://hackdavis.io/), where I was Co-President and the Lead Director of Technical responsible for making our websites (using React + Firebase) and technical educational workshops to teach web development basics to other college students. 
- **Komma**, a start-up simplifying the way people schedule meetings. Built using the MERN stack. Participated in the Spring 2021 UCD PLASMA accelerator cohort.
