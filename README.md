### Hi, I'm Omid ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 

I am a software developer currently studying computer science at UC Davis with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I take passion in using my skills to enact social good and strive to make sure that I leave a lasting positive impact on the world. I'm currently working part-time at HackDavis, a hackathon innovating for social good, and Komma, a company I am co-founding that aims to simplify the way people schedule meetings. 

### My Current Work 
- [**CodeLab**](https://code-lab-website.vercel.app/), a UC Davis club I am the VP of Projects and a Co-Founder of. My role includes guiding teams with implementing their quarterly projects for clients (Fall 2020 Client was Ambii), as well as creating guides and making project workflows for "mentored" students in an effort to teach them basic industry level languages and frameworks such as React, how to use APIs, etc. 
- [**HackDavis**](https://hackdavis.io/), a website that aims to advertise UC Davis' yearly hackathons to students. Built with React and Google Firebase using GatsbyJS. 
- **Komma**, a start-up I am co-founding with three other UCD students built on the MERN Stack with Google Auth API and AWS S3 for image hosting. Set to launch for a very early beta testing in late April 2021. 

### My Past Work
- [**Algorithmic Stock Trading Bot**](https://github.com/omidmogasemi/stock-trading-bot), a bot I built that analyzes hundreds of barsets per minute and uses popular trading algorithms to buy and sell shares at specified strike prices. Built using Python and Alpaca's Trading API, never fully completed.
