### Hi, I'm Omid ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 

I am a software developer currently studying computer science at UC Davis with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I take passion in using my skills to enact social good and strive to make sure that I leave a lasting positive impact on the world. 

### My Current Work 
- **Netflix**, where I am a SWE for the Machine Learning Platform team working on [Polynote](https://polynote.org/latest/), an OSS polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support. 

### My Past Work 
- [**Principal Financial Group**](https://www.principal.com/), where I interned in the summer of 2021 for 15 weeks as a member of the PUPP Life Calc team, responsible for calculating commissions and payment information for life insurance contracts. I engaged in pair programming with the team, spending first half of internship working on features of existing Java app, and last half converting Java code to TypeScript on AWS using Lambdas, Cloudfront, and DynamoDB. 
- [**Eduworks**](https://eduworks.com/), where I was responsible for obtaining data used to train NLP models for a job competency system by using Python to communicate with various job sourcing APIs and by webscraping. I was also responsible for programatically cleaning and tagging the data. 
- [**CodeLab**](https://www.codelabdavis.com/), a UC Davis club I was the VP of Technology and a Co-Founder of. My role included guiding teams with implementing their quarterly projects for clients, as well as creating educational material and project workflows for "mentored" students in an effort to teach them basic industry level languages and frameworks such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc. 
- [**Hands Together**](https://www.handstogether-sa.org/), a non-profit pre-school for at-risk children in Santa Ana. I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website. I have since upgraded it to use Webflow due to a lack of time to maintain its original implementation in React and and Node.js. 
- [**HackDavis**](https://hackdavis.io/), a website that aims to advertise UC Davis' yearly hackathons to students. Built with React and Google Firebase using GatsbyJS. I was Co-President and the Lead Director of Technical responsible for making the websites and educational workshops to teach web development basics to other college students. 
- **Komma**, a start-up simplifying the way people schedule meetings. Built using the MERN stack with Google Auth API and AWS S3 for image hosting I was responsible for front-end web development as well as serving as the company's CEO, discovering and directing our early business model. Participated in the Spring 2021 UCD PLASMA accelerator cohort.
