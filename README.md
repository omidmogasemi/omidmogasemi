### Hi, I'm Omid 👋

I'm a Founding Engineer at [Conductor](https://www.conductor.build/), building the AI orchestrator of the future. Before that I built infrastructure to train ML models at [Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ9UZlr6C6M). 

I'm based in SF and love to play basketball or go for runs in the park. Always feel free to reach out! You can find my contact info on my [personal website](https://www.omidmogasemi.com/).
