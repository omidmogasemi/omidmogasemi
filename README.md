### Hi, I'm Omid ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 

I am a software developer currently studying computer science at UC Davis with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I take passion in using my skills to enact social good and strive to make sure that I leave a lasting positive impact on the world. I'm currently working part-time at HackDavis, a hackathon innovating for social good, and Komma, a company I am co-founding that aims to better connect students in an increasingly online world.

### My Current Work 
- **Komma**, a website that aims to revolutionize the events industry by making it easier for students to connect with clubs on college campuses. Built with the MERN stack, Material UI, Google Auth API, and AWS S3 for image hosting. 
- [**HackDavis**](https://github.com/HackDavis/website-2021), a website that aims to advertise UC Davis' yearly hackathons to students. Built with React and Google Firebase using GatsbyJS. 
- [**Algorithmic Stock Trading Bot**](https://github.com/omidmogasemi/stock-trading-bot), a bot I am currently building that analyzes hundreds of barsets per minute and uses popular trading algorithms to buy and sell shares at specified strike prices. Built using Python and Alpaca's Trading API.
